Version Control: Git tracks every change made to files, allowing collaborators to manage revisions, experiment with new features on separate branches, and revert to previous states if necessary without impacting the main codebase.
Streamlined Workflow: The use of pull requests (PRs) enables team members to propose and review code changes, provide feedback, and resolve potential merge conflicts before integrating their work into the main branch.
Enhanced Communication: Tools like issue tracking, inline comments in PRs, and wikis provide a central hub for discussions, task management, and project documentation, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned.
